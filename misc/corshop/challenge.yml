  Who even uses GUIs anymore? As FizzBuzz101 once said so perfectly:
  “I don't believe in GUI.” People are finally waking up — ordering coffee
  over SSH, trading bloated Electron editors for the elegance of Neovim.

  At CoR, we couldn't be happier to support this movement. That's why we
  built a fun little shop you can access right from your terminal, where
  you can snag personal items from CoR members themselves!
